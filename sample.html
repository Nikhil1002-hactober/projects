        <br> Chess pieces are divided into two different colored sets. While the sets may not be literally white and
        black (e.g. the light set may be a yellowish or off-white color, the dark set may be brown or red), they are
        always referred to as "white" and "black". The players of the sets are referred to as White and Black,
        respectively. Each set consists of 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and
        eight pawns. Chess sets come in a wide variety of styles; for competition, the Staunton pattern is
        preferred.

        The game is played on a square board of eight rows (called ranks) and eight columns (called files). By
        convention, the 64 squares alternate in color and are referred to as light and dark squares; common colors
        for
        chessboards are white and brown, or white and dark green.

        The pieces are set out as shown in the diagram and photo. Thus, on White's first rank, from left to right,
        the
        pieces are placed in the following order :<i> rook</i>, <i>knight</i>, <i>bishop</i>, <i>queen</i>, <i>
            king</i>, <i> bishop</i>, <i> knight</i>, <i> rook</i>. On the second rank is placed a row of <i>eight
            pawns</i>. Black's position mirrors White's, with an equivalent piece on the same file. The board is
        placed
        with a <i>light square</i> at the <b>right-hand corner</b> nearest to each player. The correct positions of
        the
        king and queen may be remembered by the phrase <b>"queen on her own color"</b> ─ i.e. the white queen begins
        on
        a light square; the black queen on a dark square.

        <h3> &rarr; Movement of pieces</h3>
        <p>
            In competitive games, the piece colors are allocated to players by the organizers; in informal games, the
            colors
            are usually decided randomly, for example by a coin toss, or by one player concealing a white pawn in one
            hand
            and a black pawn in the other, and having the opponent choose. White moves first, after which players
            alternate
            turns, moving one piece per turn (except for castling, when two pieces are moved). A piece is moved to
            either an
            unoccupied square or one occupied by an opponent's piece, which is captured and removed from play. With the
            sole
            exception of en passant, all pieces capture by moving to the square that the opponent's piece occupies.
            Moving
            is compulsory; a player may not skip a turn, even when having to move is detrimental.

            Each piece has its own way of moving. In the diagrams, the dots mark the squares to which the piece can move
            if
            there are no intervening piece(s) of either color (except the knight, which leaps over any intervening
            pieces).
            All pieces except the pawn can capture an enemy piece if it is located on a square to which they would be
            able
            to move if the square was unoccupied. The squares on which pawns can capture enemy pieces are marked in the
            diagram with black crosses.
